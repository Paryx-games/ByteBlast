# Security Policy

Our security policy is in place to ensure the security of your device, the app and the data. See below for what versions are supported and protected under our security policy.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

Only the above version(s) are actively maintained and protected under our current security protocols.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in our app, please report it via the "Security" tab at the top. This will privately contact us maintainers to fix the error as soon as we can.

ðŸš« **Do not** open a public issue, post a discussion, or edit the wiki with vulnerability details. Doing so could expose critical flaws to bad actors before theyâ€™re patched.

## Timeline
We aim to:
- Acknowledge reports within **48 hours**
- Issue fixes within **7â€“14 business days**, depending on severity

## Disclosure
By submitting a report, you agree not to publicly disclose the issue until weâ€™ve resolved it or mutually agreed upon a timeline. Failure to do so will result in your post/discussion being deleted and you being banned from our GitHub page. Security vulnerabilities are not jokes and can cause serious harm to devices that are not protected from them.
